If you're interested implementing a sample app, that will be awesome.
I'm trying to use Chinook database sample found here
[http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Chinook_Schema&referringTitle=Documentation](http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Chinook_Schema&referringTitle=Documentation)

The `db` file is located in 'assets' folder. see [`SampleApp.java`](https://github.com/bingzer/DbQuery/blob/master/Sample/src/main/java/com/bingzer/android/dbv/sample/SampleApp.java)
